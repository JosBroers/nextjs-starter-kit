# Next.js Starter Kit

This Next.js starter kit was bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) and has the following features:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/#/homeeslint)
- [Next-PWA](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-pwa)
- [Security headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/security-headers)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## 1. Setup

### 1.1 Node.js

First install the Node.js with `nvm use` version listed in `.nvmrc`. Use a Node Version Manager such as [NVM for Mac](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

### 1.2 Installing dependencies

After successfully installing Node.js run `yarn` to install all the packages and then `yarn dev` to start developing.

### 1.3 TypeScript

This starter kit uses **TypeScript** out of the box. If you don't feel comfortable using it or don't need it, just rename all the files to their JavaScript equivalent (`.js` and `.jsx`) and uninstall TypeScript and all the @types listed in the `package.json`.

### 1.4 Preact

Besides TypeScript this starter kit uses **Preact** over React for production builds. This results in smaller build and the same developer experience. Want to switch back to **React**? Simply delete or comment out the code below in `next.config.js` and uninstall the package.

```js
webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
	if (!dev && !isServer) {
		Object.assign(config.resolve.alias, {
			react: "preact/compat",
			"react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
			"react-dom": "preact/compat",
		})
	}

	return config
},
```

## 2. Scripts

- Use `yarn` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies
- Use `yarn dev` to start a local dev server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- To build the application for production, use `yarn build`
- To start a production server, use `yarn start`
- To export application as static HTML, use `next build && next export`
- For checking on unused imports, use `yarn find:unused`
- For analyzing the chunks and modules, use `yarn analyze`
- For analyzing dependencies in the project, use `yarn depcheck`
- For updating the `.nvmrc` file with the current Node.js version, use `yarn node`

## 3. Security

By default Next.js doesn't provide all the **security headers** which results in a vulnerable application. I've added the default security headers listed in the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/security-headers). To test your application for security headers, visit [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/)

## 4. Styling

With Next.js there's a lot of options to style your projects. This starter kit uses **Sass** and **Sass Modules**, but use whatever works best for you. For example:

- [A global stylesheet](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet)
- [CSS (or Sass) Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css)
- [CSS-in-JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)

## 5. Search engine optimization

Coming soon...

## 6. Environment variables

Next.js has built-in support for environment variables and the option to expose variables to the browser by prefixing with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. In this starter kit we use a variable for the Google Tag Manager container-ID: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM`. Setup this variable inside a `.env` file to start using Google Tag Manager.

## 7. Vercel CLI

Whenever possible, I recommend deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It's free, easy to use and gets you running within minutes (hint: This template was deployed via **Vercel**). A few commands to get you started:

- Install Vercel CLI with `npm install -g vercel`
- Connect a project with `vercel link` and configure credentials accordingly
- Use `vercel env pull` to get the environment variables
- Use `vercel dev` to deploy a local test server at http://localhost:3000
- Use `vercel` to deploy a preview build
- Use `vercel --prod` to deploy a production build
